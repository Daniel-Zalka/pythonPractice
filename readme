# (daniel project - functions)
The code is three functions and each has a different function:

1.  A function that summarizes the rows and columns in the list, each one individually.
    The function returns as an answer the index number that the sum of the members in the same row is the highest,
    and returns separately the number of the column with the highest amount.

2. A function that checks which index divides all the numbers that follow it and is divided by all the numbers before that index,"
    the function returns at the end of the run the index number that satisfies the two conditions.

3. The function takes on new values and uses them to sum up the newly created rectangle
